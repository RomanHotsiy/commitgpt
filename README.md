## How to use?

```bash
npx commitgpt
```

### Get OpenAI api key
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

### Configuration (Optional)
you can create `.commitgpt.json` and/or `.commitgpt-template` config files in your project root. 

#### `.commitgpt.json` file
default: 
```json
{
  "model": "text-davinci-003",
  "temperature": 0.5,
  "maxTokens": 2048,
}
```
this file can be used to change the openai model and other parameters.


### `.commitgpt-template` file
default:
```
suggest 10 commit messages based on the following diff:
{{diff}}
commit messages should:
 - follow conventional commits
 - message format should be: <type>(scope): <description>

examples:
 - fix(authentication): add password regex pattern
 - feat(storage): add new test cases
```

this file can be used to change the template used to generate the prompt request. you can modify the template to fit your needs.

## How it works

- Runs `git diff --cached`
- Sends the diff to ChatGPT and asks it to suggest commit messages
- Shows suggestions to the user
